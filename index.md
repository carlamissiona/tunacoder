   ```
   # Configuring DJango Models
    class Company(models.Model):
      name = models.TextField(default='Company')
      date_modified = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
      date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
      
   ```
It's easy to start a Django site. It will take time to configure it but everything will be easy since Django gives admin site with just a few configuration and a backend for your API.


```
from django.urls import include, path
from rest_framework import routers

from . import views 

router = routers.DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'company', views.CompanyViewSet)

# Wire up our API using automatic URL routing.
# Additionally, we include login URLs for the browsable API.
urlpatterns = [
    path('rest/', include(router.urls)),
    path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework'))
] 
```

Mixtapes is an online site which takes videos from vimeo api. The videos are hidden from frontend DOM. There's still a lot of work left in this project.

## Rust Warp Website
This code was developed on gitpod. I got some error on my main code that sidetracked my progress. The editor I m using failed to save. Good thing the code for Warp framework is still simple enought to follow by beginner rust devs.

My code managed to give a route with json serde and a static file serve on the get endpoint /static. Warp is overall good minimalist framework although it requires a full feature of tokio.
