## Microservices
I have worked on serverless environment before, but I didnt understand microservice entirely until I learned some Devops skills. I tried to learn Kubernetes and Docker. Here is a microservice I deployed on a free kubernetes cluster on okteto.

## Go Fiber Graphql and Vue JS
In this site I wrote a cdn vue js which is a fairly easy technique for SPA. Then I used Go Fiber for backend  and Graphql with queries from Hasura server.
I like using Hasura its got a lot of feature and it offers free hosting for query playground.

**API** 
This site has API hooked on it. Ruby managed to complete the traditional crud for the API data model
```
https://radiobuddy.carlamissiona.repl.co/api/price/1


# Aside from the manually written API, Ruby also auto build API base on model

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :prices
  get '/', to: 'pages#home'

```
