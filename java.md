## Java Spring Web
### [Back To Index](https://carlamissiona.github.io/tunacoder/index) 

These are the java spring I wrote in the past days. Java spring although it is good for monolithic app, is a comprehensive solution for the web.  
There are problems with the Spring memory <br>footprint and deploying it as a single service is inappropriate. That's why there are microservices frameworks
that are now created to be used in the microservice setup.
